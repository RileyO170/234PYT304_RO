The following structure of the 7-week program was as follows:

| Week # | Title of Module | Assignment Overview | Assignment Overview |
| :-------------: | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| 1 | Introduction to Data Science | Intro to NVIDIA Rapids in a Google Colab Environment | See Jupyter Notebook files in the HW1 Folder |
| 2 | Data Collection | Scrapy: Building our first production scraper | All files are contained in the HW2 Folder, except for the virtual envioronment (venv, or .venv) files used to setup the venv in VSCode |
| 3 | AWS Data Engineering (Processing Big Data) | Launching an Amazon EMR cluster | Lab performed through AWS Canvas course |
| 4 | Scalable Computing (w/ Dask + UCX) | Working w/ Dask DataFrames in a Google Colab Environment | See Jupyter Notebook files in the HW4 Folder (note: the _RO ran into errors) |
| 5 | AWS Data Engineering (Storing + Organizing Data) | Performing ETL on a Dataset by Using AWS Glue | Lab performed through AWS Canvas course |
| 6 | Code Backup + Version Control | Building + Orchestrating ETL Pipelines Using AWS Athena and Step Functions | Lab performed through AWS Canvas course |
| 7 | AWS Data Engineering (Processing Data for Machine Learning) | Learning about AWS SageMaker, CodeWhisperer, and Creating a GitHub for the course | See this GitHub! |

**NOTE: For weeks where we performed AWS labs (Weeks 3, 5, 6), there are no real files to upload, since we performed the labs through an AWS Canvas environment. So, for those three weeks, there will not be "deliverables" in those folders**
